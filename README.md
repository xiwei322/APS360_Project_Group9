# APS360_Project_Group9 - Traffic Sign Recognition

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify German traffic signs using the GTSRB dataset. The goal is to preprocess image data, train a deep learning model, and evaluate its performance on a real-world multi-class classification task.

## Dataset
- Source: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
